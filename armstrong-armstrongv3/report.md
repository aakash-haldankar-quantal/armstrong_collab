This structured approach ensures that each component of the client's financial situation is thoroughly examined and integrated into a cohesive financial strategy. The process involves parsing initial client data and forming an initial state, followed by sequential delegation of detailed analysis and planning tasks to relevant specialist agents, including Client Profiling, Asset & Liability Analysis, Goal Setting, Retirement Planning, Education Planning, Debt Management, and a Financial Health Audit. Finally, the ReportGeneratorAgent synthesizes all findings into a comprehensive client report in Markdown format.
