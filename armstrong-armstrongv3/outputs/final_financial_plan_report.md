### Recommended Actions
1. Prioritize monthly savings through a structured SIP in equity MFs for long-term capital growth.
2. Reduce discretionary spends (e.g., high-priority short-term goals like vacations/electronics).  
3. Explore partial downshifting of retirement age if needed.  
4. Consider higher-yield debt products for liquidity-building.  

**Next Steps Summary**:  
Hari must focus on maximizing savings (current surpluses neutral), renegotiate lifestyle adjustments, and discuss ways to optimize investment instruments to close gaps for retirement. Short-term goals should be re-prioritized in line with critical long-term needs, particularly Higher Education and Corpus Building.
